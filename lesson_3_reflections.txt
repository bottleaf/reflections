1.) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository when you want to keep a back-up in case you lose your local repository,
when you have multiple contributors, or when you want to show others your projects.

2.) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There could be conflicts if you have local commits that are not yet pushed.

3.) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are a new chain of edits within the same repo.  It is used to work on multiple features independently with the eventual goal of merging viable branches into the main/production branch.

A clone is a copy of a repo; It can be used to work on a local copy of a repo that is stored on github.

A fork is a clone between github repos.  A fork is used to get a copy of a large collaborative project on one's own github account.  This allows the use to pull from their own github account.

# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The directory becomes a git repository.  A .git fie is made.  It needs to be done because

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
-the staging area only includes files that are going to be commited
What value do you think it offers?
It allows logical seperation since often one logical change often doesn't
involve all the files

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is being able to merge and update the remote when there is no internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We would send files to each other through email and keep track of the "master" file by file labeling.  Different iterations would just have 1,2,3.. after file name.
It would be harder to keep track of all these files and stay organized.  This method might be easier since it doesn't require learning git commands or knowing how
github works.
